## API Endpoints

### Authentication (Better Auth)

All auth endpoints are prefixed with `/api/auth/`:

- `POST /api/auth/sign-up/email` - Register new user (auto-creates company for first user)
- `POST /api/auth/sign-in/email` - Sign in with email/password
- `POST /api/auth/sign-out` - Sign out
- `GET /api/auth/session` - Get current session

- `POST /api/approval-rules` - Create approval rule
- `PUT /api/approval-rules/:ruleId` - Update approval rule
- `DELETE /api/approval-rules/:ruleId` - Delete approval rule

### Countries & Currencies

- `GET /api/countries` - Get all countries with currencies
- `GET /api/countries/:countryName/currency` - Get currency for specific country

## Core Features Explained

### 1. Authentication & Company Auto-Creation

On **first signup**:
- Company is automatically created
- User is assigned **ADMIN** role
- Company currency is set based on country (default: United States → USD)

```bash
# First user signup
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/sign-up/email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Admin User","email":"admin@company.com","password":"Pass123!"}'
```

### 2. User Management (Admin Role)

Admins can:
- Create Employees and Managers
- Assign roles: `EMPLOYEE`, `MANAGER`, `ADMIN`
- Define manager-employee relationships
- Update user roles anytime

```bash
# Create employee with manager assigned
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/users \
  -b cookies.txt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"John Doe","email":"john@company.com","role":"EMPLOYEE","managerId":"manager-uuid"}'
```

### 3. Expense Submission (Employee Role)

Employees can:
- Submit expenses in **any currency** (EUR, GBP, INR, etc.)
- View their expense history (Approved, Rejected, Pending)
- Track approval status

```bash
# Submit expense in different currency
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/expenses \
  -b cookies.txt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 1500,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "category": "Travel",
    "description": "Business trip to Paris",
    "date": "2025-10-01"
  }'
```

### 4. Approval Workflow System

#### Manager Approval First (`isManagerApprover`)

If enabled, expense goes to employee's manager first before applying other rules.

#### Sequential Approval (Multiple Approvers)

Admin defines approval sequence:
- **Step 1** → Manager
- **Step 2** → Finance
- **Step 3** → Director

Expense moves to next approver **only after** current one approves/rejects.

#### Approval Rule Types

**SEQUENTIAL**: All approvers in order
```json
{
  "name": "Standard Approval",
  "ruleType": "SEQUENTIAL",
  "isManagerApprover": true,
  "sequence": 1
}
```

**PERCENTAGE**: Minimum % of approvers needed
```json
{
  "name": "60% Approval Rule",
  "ruleType": "PERCENTAGE",
  "approvalPercentage": 60,
  "sequence": 2
}
```

**SPECIFIC**: Specific user approval auto-approves
```json
{
  "name": "CFO Approval",
  "ruleType": "SPECIFIC",
  "specificApproverId": "cfo-user-uuid",
  "sequence": 3
}
```

**HYBRID**: Combine PERCENTAGE + SPECIFIC (OR logic)
```json
{
  "name": "60% OR CFO Approves",
  "ruleType": "HYBRID",
  "approvalPercentage": 60,
  "specificApproverId": "cfo-user-uuid",
  "sequence": 4
}
```

### 5. Approval Actions

Managers/Admins can:
- View pending approvals
- Approve with comments
- Reject with mandatory comments
- View approval history

```bash
# Approve expense
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/approvals/{approvalStepId}/approve \
  -b cookies.txt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"comments":"Approved - valid expense"}'

# Reject expense
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/approvals/{approvalStepId}/reject \
  -b cookies.txt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"comments":"Not a valid business expense"}'
```

### 6. Role-Based Permissions

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **ADMIN** | Create company (auto), manage users, set roles, configure approval rules, view all expenses, override approvals |
| **MANAGER** | Approve/reject expenses, view team expenses, escalate per rules, amounts in company currency |
| **EMPLOYEE** | Submit expenses, view own expenses, check approval status |

## Database Schema

- **ApprovalRule** - Configurable rules (SEQUENTIAL, PERCENTAGE, SPECIFIC, HYBRID)
- **ApprovalStep** - Individual approval steps with sequence, status, and comments
- **Session** - Better Auth session management
- **Account** - Better Auth account management

### Enums

- **UserRole**: `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `EMPLOYEE`
- **ExpenseStatus**: `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`
- **ApprovalRuleType**: `SEQUENTIAL`, `PERCENTAGE`, `SPECIFIC`, `HYBRID`
- **ApprovalStepStatus**: `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`

```

## Important Notes

### Better Auth Integration

⚠️ **Critical Middleware Order**: The Better Auth handler must be mounted **BEFORE** `express.json()` middleware.

✅ **Correct Order** (in `server.ts`):
```typescript
app.use("/api/auth", toNodeHandler(auth));  // Raw body needed for Better Auth
app.use(express.json());                    // Parse JSON after auth routes
```

❌ **Wrong Order** (will cause issues):
```typescript
app.use(express.json());                    // ✗ Don't put this first
app.use("/api/auth", toNodeHandler(auth));  // ✗ Too late, body already parsed
```

### Multi-Tenant Company Isolation

All queries **MUST** filter by `companyId` to maintain data isolation:

```typescript
// ✅ Correct - with company filter
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: { companyId: req.user.companyId }
});

// ❌ Wrong - missing company filter (security risk!)
const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
```

### Session Management

- **Duration**: 7 days with 1-day update age
- **Storage**: HTTP-only cookies (secure)
- **Verification**: Use `requireAuth` middleware to populate `req.user`

### Approval Workflow Logic

1. **Expense submitted** → Generate approval steps based on rules
2. **isManagerApprover = true** → Manager gets Step 1
3. **Sequential approvers** → Assigned with sequence numbers (2, 3, 4...)
4. **Current step tracking** → Only current step approver can act
5. **Conditional rules** → Check PERCENTAGE/SPECIFIC/HYBRID for auto-approval
6. **Status update** → Move to next step OR mark as APPROVED/REJECTED

### Currency Handling

- Expenses can be submitted in **any currency**
- Company has a **baseCurrency** (set on creation from country)
- Currency conversion service uses exchangerate-api.com
- Managers/Admins see amounts with original currency preserved

### Error Handling

Use `AppError` class for consistent error responses:

```typescript
throw new AppError("User not found", 404);
throw new AppError("Unauthorized", 401);
throw new AppError("Validation failed", 400);
```

All errors are caught by the global error handler middleware.

## Deployment

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Set strong `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (use crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))
- [ ] Update `DATABASE_URL` with production credentials
- [ ] Set `FRONTEND_URL` to production domain
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/SSL for cookies
- [ ] Run migrations: `npm run db:migrate`
- [ ] Build application: `npm run build`
- [ ] Use process manager (PM2, systemd)
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure logging (Winston, Pino)
- [ ] Set up monitoring (Sentry, New Relic)
- [ ] Enable rate limiting
- [ ] Configure CORS for production domain

### Environment Variables

Production `.env`:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@prod-db:5432/expense_mgmt"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="32-byte-random-hex-string"

## Known Issues & Notes

### Auth Known Issue (Documented in FRONTEND_AUTH_INTEGRATION.md)

⚠️ **Issue**: Standard Better Auth signup sometimes fails on signin
- **Root Cause**: Account record creation timing with database hooks
- **Status**: Under investigation
- **Workaround**: Custom signup endpoint at `/api/auth-custom/signup` (if needed)

### Database Hooks

Company auto-creation is handled by Better Auth `databaseHooks.user.create.after` in `lib/auth.ts`.
